ðŸ“ŠðŸš€ Excited to share my first-ever data analytics project! ðŸŽ‰

After diving into the world of data analytics, I'm thrilled to present my Excel dashboard project. ðŸ“Šâœ¨ Though it may not match the incredible dashboards created by seasoned analysts, I believe it holds great value for beginners like me. Here are the key learnings I'd like to share:

ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning: The foundation of any analysis. Cleaning raw data by removing extra spaces, duplicates, and format disruptions is crucial for creating an organized and structured table.

ðŸ”¹ Data Arrangement: Simplify complex data representations! Instead of a long list of individual ages, grouping them into age brackets makes it easier to understand and interpret.

ðŸ”¹ Pivot Tables & Charts: Pivot tables are a game-changer! Understanding their customization options and leveraging features like slicers allow for a more focused and visually appealing analysis presentation.

ðŸ”¹ Slicers: One-click insights! Slicers bring the power of interactivity to your dashboard, enabling viewers to explore data from multiple angles effortlessly.

ðŸ”¹ Color Combinations and Chart Selection: Visual impact matters! Avoid monochromatic colors and opt for distinct color schemes that enhance clarity. Keep charts simple with clear axes and titles.

ðŸ”¹ Annotations and Alignment: Clarity is key! Use explicit annotations like "MALE" or "FEMALE" instead of abbreviations. Pay attention to proper alignment and arrangement to create a professional and intuitive dashboard.
